#Okay, on first review I can see an opportunity to implement the grid layout like I did before, so the main container has a clamp to set the width across a variety of sizes, there is a gap, and then 1fr columns on the outside that go to 1px on extremely tiny screens. This keeps the gap in play even when the screen goes smaller than designed for.

I'll just set the main content in row 2, with row 1 and row 3 also being 1fr.

#Then when it comes to the main content, I'm going to duplicate that setup, but only the columns. As I discovered before, using padding does have its advantages, and I'm going to use that on the bottom of the container. Using a 3 column setup, however, will let me easily set the hero image to break out of the center column, while the rest of the content is contained. 

##Content components

  - a hero image which breaks out of the center column
  - a dialog component
  - a flex container with gap consisting of:
    - a special dialog container (this is the plan information)
    - a ball to action button
    - a minimalist cancel button (this could just be the text as well

The content itself does shrink when going to mobile sizes, and that should be pretty easy to control with a clamp. In the flex container the content will also shrink vertically, and that might be a combination of elements shrinking in size, as well as gap constricting. 

##Started with the component items

  - I did the plan-details first, which will be part of the purchase section, or something like that
  - Next the other buttons that will accompany the plan-details
